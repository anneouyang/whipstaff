A formal specification of the [CBC Casper consensus protocols](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper) written in TLA+ and PlusCal (transpiled to TLA+). 

- Currently using one member of this family of protocols, the binary consensus protocol, as an example
- Message authentication is not included in this specification due to the assumption that the validators can verify the authenticity and source of messages
